# RelayControllerTest
This is a test project to build better communication and control between a netduino controlling a thermostat (with programming logic based on the datetime) and another
netduino plus 2 connected to network which reads sensor data from various sensor stations and uploads to a database.  The networked 
netduino will be internet-enabled to control the relay sensor remotely.
